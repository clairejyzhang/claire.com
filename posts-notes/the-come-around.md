Attention, our cities, our mothers, 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; reading your letters: dear tonight 

&nbsp;

But the blindness of the day, the fruitbearer

Come here 

Will you let me dance a little? 

&nbsp;

His hand, salted. Her body out of the forest, pines, please, a funeral.

The flow of water from a pitcher — lucky

Who holds you at their neck?

&nbsp;

All the children — someone says their names every day. Every day

the factory says here’s to running 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; and living more 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; on streets told with “after these welcomes”

They are learning how to sing

&nbsp;

Where are you going? 

Lay back in the stone someday

It’s true that there are no rivers in Denver Colorado 

&nbsp;

The almond tree ministered a wedding 

and gave rest to a girl becoming nameless during sunrise. She discovered how to be religious

But where in this month’s heaven can she find 

the same sweetness?
