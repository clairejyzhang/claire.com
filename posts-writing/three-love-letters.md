1.  Mary loves you

Light shining through skin is not enough, so\
Light becomes warmth. I take it up,\
A little bird in my palm\
I’m sorry I don’t have anything for the pain\
But to tell the truth, your heart beating strong under my fingers\
An iron gate, or an unwatered garden – Where are your children?\
Hands folded as we say goodbye

&nbsp; 

2. Your hair after mine

You in the image of me. Skin growing thick\
We were forced into the years it all took place, or were taught to do so\
Since you should not be changed, I will have to bend the earth, and that\
What were you going to tell me then?\
In the rain where I wished to be


&nbsp;

3. Will that be the way I die too?

And is this the way you wanted it, the space next to your name\
The flowers to my hands, otherwise a mirror\
In excess of dust and salt and water\
Three bows today, three bows tomorrow\
A white dress carried the time – the time wishing itself without\
My mother, what was she like when she was young?\
So say my little name, that is to say call me yours\
Did you know about me?\
Please write back soon
