Because of my contract, I won't show any specific wireframes or artifacts I worked on. Instead, here are some of my takeaways.

&nbsp;

As demographic trends continue to shift, we'll need to create better ways to care for an aging global population. AI helps us create more personalized solutions for older adults that fit their unique needs. It also enables us to deliver low-cost services that once needed to be delivered by an expensive expert. 

&nbsp;

Tomorrow's seniors are not necessarily the same as today's - design for your future customer. Consider large-scale trends to predict their needs 1, 5, and 10 years from now.

&nbsp;

It's easy to get swept up in the glamour of a new and exciting technology, but cutting-edge tech is useless in a bad design. When in doubt, always go back to the user to validate decisions.

&nbsp;

How do we create solutions that not only address older adults' problems, but holistically increase their well-being? My work this summer was only one answer, and I hope to continue working on more in the future.
