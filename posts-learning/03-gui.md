### How can I use intentional design to minimize the completion time and mental load of repetitive, complex tasks?

Researchers at a computational neuroscience lab needed to manually annotate large amounts of audiovisual data generated by gerbils moving around in a territory and making vocalizations. The current GUI design was visually overwhelming, difficult to navigate, and didn't leave enough space for the video frame box, making annotation inefficient:

To make a first pass at understanding the process flow I observed researchers using the GUI, interviewed them about their experiences afterwards, and tried using the tool myself. I wrote pseudocode breaking down researchers' actions into an algorithmic sequence:

Once I understood the process flow, I iterated on prototypes with the following goals in mind:
+ Optimize tasks: minimize the distance the user has to move their mouse or scroll, minimize the number of clicks, etc.
+ Create a clear visual hierarchy that minimizes non-useful ink
+ In this case, an ideal design is one where the user doesn't notice the GUI's design at all â€” they're free to solely focus on the annotation task

After multiple rounds of prototyping and testing, I created a final prototype:

During averaged timed trials of three researchers before and after redesign, the new design reduced annotation speed by 31%. I also helped implement the design changes in the existing GUI codebase using functional TypeScript.
