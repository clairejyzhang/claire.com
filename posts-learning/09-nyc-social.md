### Prompt: Design something that increases repurposing/reusing in New York City

### Why community building? Every young professional New Yorker we interviewed indicated a need for more social connectivity

We conducted six exploratory interviews with young professional New Yorkers and got open to any insights they might share, but were surprised when they all indicated a common unmet need before we even mentioned our specific focus on repurposing/reusing.

&nbsp;

Repurposing/reusing doesn't always have to refer to physical objects, so we decided to follow our users and keep digging, even if it wasn't the direction we expected. To further explore the problem space and understand why young professionals' social connectivity needs weren't currently being met, we returned to our initial interviewees and conducted ethnographic interviews about how they socialized.

&nbsp;
### Before we became more comfortable with each other as a team, AI acted as a social lubricant by providing a common ground

While we pursued this design project, we also explored how using AI as a generative teammate affected our team's interpersonal dynamics and ideation. We used ChatGPT to aggregate insights from the ethnographic interview transcripts and prompted it to propose several problem statements using those insights. We found that AI was especially helpful when we were first getting to know each other as a team: its outputs acted as a common ground for us to iterate from.

After several rounds of ideating solutions, reevaluating the problem space, and returning to users, we refined the problem statement as follows:

#### Young professionals lack opportunities for spontaneous networking and making new connections due to limited availability of open facilities outside of work hours, absence of built-in communities, and a lack of awareness about available options for socializing outside of their work environment.

&nbsp;

Problem statement in hand, we started brainstorming solutions.

&nbsp;

### AI's training limitations meant it didn't contribute any new or interesting ideas during brainstorming

Even though we went through several rounds of prompting ChatGPT, it only proposed solutions we'd already seen in our background research, which makes sense: AI can only ever be as original or creative as its training data. If a problem still exists, it's probably because there aren't enough creative solutions out there. So ChatGPT won't be trained on those sorts of innovative ideas, and it won't generate those sorts of innovative ideas. But how can we train an AI to be more creative than we are ourselves? One approach, which we're already seeing, is to train AI on data generated by other AI, but this kind of model would be very likely to amplify bias/noise in the original data.

&nbsp;

### Ultimately, human-led brainstorming was more interesting and thought-provoking

We tried to do Crazy 8's, but it ended being more like Crazy 6's... Time pressure forced us to be more creative and outside-the-box, which doesn't happen with AI.

### Our users felt most compelled by an idea called Bridge that leverages friends of friends

Bridge makes it easy for you to meet your friends of friends. If your friend wants to go out somewhere, like to a cafe, and wants to meet new people, they open a hangout on Bridge. Bridge sends a mass invite to everyone in your friend’s network, including you. You accept the invite and can also send it to everyone in your own network. Now when you go out, it’s with a mix of old friends and new connections. Those new connections join your network and will get invites to any hangouts you open in the future. Bridge users' networks grow exponentially, maximizing the potential for chance new encounters.

##### A strong visual identity appeals to young adults and provides lots of potential for future creative exploration.

&nbsp;

Bridge starts when someone in your network opens a hangout at a public space like a cafe, park, or jazz bar. Bridge invites everyone in their network though typically only a percentage of those invited can actually join. You can get the invite directly from the opener, or it can be passed onto you through a mutual connection. Here, Pol B started a hangout and sent it to Harry West, who sent it to Claire.

&nbsp;

You can accept the invite and can also send it out to everyone in your own network. Play around with the interaction **[here](https://www.figma.com/proto/KJ1WPoduLQOvvlFpdfy5bx/bridge---yes%2Fsend-interactions?type=design&node-id=1-50&t=ZT9Ueww1VlqMaURh-1&scaling=contain&page-id=0%3A1&mode=design)** - just press and hold on 'yes' or 'send'. 

&nbsp;

When you attend the same hangout as someone, Bridge automatically adds them to your network. Each edge is color-coded by the hangout you met at, creating a colorful 3D model that grows as you meet more people.

Our friendships and relationships with other people are what make us human. Bridge helps you make meaningful connections and find community.

### Further exploration: creating a strong visual identity through small, coherent details

It took me about 8 hours to go from blank Figma workspace to these first-pass wireframes. With more time, I want to play around with smaller details: micro-animations, fun colors, and typography that represent how Bridge makes users feel.
