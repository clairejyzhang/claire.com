### Prompt: Design something that increases repurposing/reusing in New York City

### Why community building? Every young professional New Yorker we interviewed indicated a need for more social connectivity

We conducted six exploratory interviews with young professional New Yorkers and got open to any insights they might share, but were surprised when they all indicated a common unmet need before we even mentioned our specific focus on repurposing/reusing.

Repurposing/reusing doesn't always have to refer to physical objects, so we decided to follow our users and keep digging, even if it wasn't the direction we expected. To further explore the problem space and understand why young professionals' social connectivity needs weren't currently being met, we returned to our initial interviewees and conducted ethnographic interviews about how they socialized.

### Before we became more comfortable with each other as a team, AI acted as a social lubricant by providing a common ground

While we pursued this design project, we also explored how using AI as a generative teammate affected our team's interpersonal dynamics and ideation. We used ChatGPT to aggregate insights from the ethnographic interview transcripts and prompted it to propose several problem statements using those insights. We found that AI was especially helpful when we were first getting to know each other as a team: its outputs acted as a common ground for us to iterate from.

After several rounds of ideating solutions, reevaluating the problem space, and returning to users, we've currently refined the problem statement as follows:

#### Young professionals lack opportunities for spontaneous networking and making new connections due to limited availability of open facilities outside of work hours, absence of built-in communities, and a lack of awareness about available options for socializing outside of their work environment.

&nbsp;

Problem statement in hand, we started brainstorming solutions.

### AI's training limitations meant it didn't contribute any new or interesting ideas during brainstorming

Even though we went through several rounds of prompting ChatGPT, it only proposed solutions we'd already seen in our background research, which makes sense: AI can only ever be as original or creative as its training data. If a problem still exists, it's probably because there aren't enough creative solutions out there. So ChatGPT won't be trained on those sorts of innovative ideas, and it won't generate those sorts of innovative ideas. But how can we train an AI to be more creative than we are ourselves? One approach, which we're already seeing, is to train AI on data generated by other AI, but this kind of model would be very likely to amplify bias/noise in the original data.

&nbsp;

### Ultimately, human-led brainstorming was more interesting and thought-provoking

We tried to do Crazy 8's, but it ended being more like Crazy 6's. Time pressure forced us to be more creative, which isn't a constraint for AI.
