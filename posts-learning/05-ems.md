### Working as an EMT helped me become a better designer 

In 2023 I spent 200 hours as a volunteer emergency medical technician (EMT), where I realized that EMTs are really just designers turned to 100. Designers interview their users to develop a deep understanding of their needs, brainstorm ideas, and create solutions that meet those needs,  over weeks or months, in low-pressure settings where mistakes are part of the process. EMTs develop rapport with their patients to understand their symptoms, decide on an intervention, and administer treatment in minutes, in extremely high-pressure settings where mistakes can do serious damage. Here's what I learned:

### How to interview users effectively by finding and following the story

By treating all kinds of patients, from college students to older adults, in high-stakes contexts, I've learned how to tailor my approach to the individual user, ask thoughtful questions, and dig deep until I understand the entire story behind a problem.

### How to be a user advocate

At the emergency department, EMTs go out of their way to advocate for their patients to hospital staff to make sure their stay is as comfortable as possible, whether that's prioritizing the patient to get a bed sooner or requesting cold packs for an injury. Sometimes I was the only person I anticipating my patients' needs and ensuring those needs were met. Now, as a designer, I constantly ask, "What can I do to make this experience better for the user?", even if that means asking hard questions.

### How to read my team's needs and work where I'll have the most impact

When four EMTs are all treating one patient, things can get hectic. I learned to work as a flexible and dynamic team member, sticking to my role when needed but also taking on additional responsibilities if I noticed a gap in our care.

### How to build a culture of feedback

Many patients are unwilling to give feedback to EMTs even if they're in pain, because they don't want to seem 'difficult.' I learned to proactively ask for patient feedback, evangelizing patient interaction from the start as a two-way conversation rather than a one-sided interaction. I also gave and received feedback from the rest of the crew in scrum-like debriefs after each call where we reflected on what went well, what could have gone better, and our goals for next time.
