      <p>This site is intended to be a personal archive where I keep track of my writing, both nonfiction and creative. For me, writing = thinking. My nonfiction writing is where I process and internalize my experiences related to work/a future career. It also has the benefit of being something for potential employers to look at, but I don't want that to be the main purpose of this site. My creative writing is a way for me to process and explore my own (notoriously bad) memory. I'm really interested in how recalling things through creative writing filters and changes those experiences.</p>

      <br>

      <p>The people who visit this site are probably going to fall into two different groups: 1) potential employer and 2) someone I know personally. If you're a potential employer and you're reading this, I hope you're liking what you're seeing so far. If you're someone I know personally, why are you stalking me ðŸ¤¨</p>
