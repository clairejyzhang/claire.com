This site is intended to be a personal archive where I keep track of my writing, both nonfiction and creative. For me, writing = thinking. My nonfiction writing is where I process and internalize my experiences related to work/a future career. It also has the benefit of being something for potential employers to look at, but I don't want that to be the main purpose of this site. My creative writing is a way for me to process and explore my own memory. I'm really interested in how recalling things through creative writing filters and changes those memories. I'm also interested in abstracting language away from meaning. Or maybe it's abstracting meaning away from language? I don't really know...

The people who visit this site are probably going to fall into two different groups: 1) potential employer and 2) someone I know personally. If you're a potential employer and you're reading this, I hope you're liking what you're seeing so far. If you're someone I know personally, why are you stalking me ðŸ¤¨
